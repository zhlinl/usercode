The main aim of this program is to select the Exotica qqbar state.

Based on the aim change the value.
TriMuRECO=cms.bool(False), # Tri-Muon selection not used for Exotica qqbar state selection
OniaTrackRECO=cms.bool(True), # Onia plus track selection
OniaDiTrackRECO=cms.bool(True), # Onia plus two track selection

To run the program you can do like this.

scram project CMSSW CMSSW_4_2_8  #(or newer)
cd CMSSW_4_2_8/src/
cvs co -r V01-15-01 MuonAnalysis/MuonAssociators #(when you have this package, don't need this step)
cvs co -r HEAD -d B2MuMuX UserCode/zhlinl/B2MuMuX
scram b
cmsRun B2MuMuX_data_Run2011A_Prompt.py (change the source root file)

Other parameter you want to change you need read the program or inform me.
Thank you use the program.
