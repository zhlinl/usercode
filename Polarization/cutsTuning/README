First, you need to create a private TTree including the muon and dimuon cut variables.
By doing following:
---------------------------------
CMSSW_3_8_6
Onia2MuMu-V6
	HeavyFlavorAnalysis/Onia2MuMu V00-12-01
	MuonAnalysis/MuonAssociators V01-10-02
**USE this macro "JPsiAnalyzerPAT.cc" instead of that one in the Onia2MuMu package
**SET "applyCuts = cms.bool(False)" to False if it is True, in jpsianalyzerpat_cfg.py

PAT tuples(Nov4ReReco, Run2010B):
/MuOnia/fat-Run2010B-Nov4ReReco_v1-Onia2MuMu-v6-52b0ce2a29246dfcd7fb39d814d6fb33/USER

0. "fitPeak.cc" is used to fit the mass distributions.

1. "cutAna.cc" is used to get the "effSig" and "rejBkg" for every cut individually. 
Need to include the macro "fitPeak.cc" to fit the Jpsi Mass distributions, and get the quantities we need.

2. "cutSBG.cc" to get the S/BG change trend with the CUTs one by one.

3. "effTrackMu.cc" is used to look the dependency on pT and Eta of 
the tracker muon binary cuts: TMOneStationTight , TMLastStationAngTight
